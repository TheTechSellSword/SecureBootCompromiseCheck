# ABOUT

This repo contains scripts to check if your system is compromised due to the issue of 
"SecureBoot" being compromised on over 200 models.

## Scripts

There are 2 main scripts:

	1. linux.sh
	2. windows.ps1

The "linux" script will be useful for users of Ubuntu and Fedora based distros 
and the "windows" powershell script is for Window10 & 11. 

These scripts were based on the "Am I affected?" section of the arsTECHNICA article.
